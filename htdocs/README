  These are sample CGI scripts and webpages for tinyhttpd.  They can
be redistributed under the terms of the GPL.

  The most impressive demonstration I gave of tinyhttpd to my
professor and my classmates was to load color.cgi with a value of
"chartreuse." :)  It's actually a very simple script, guys.
